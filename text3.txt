She opened her eyes slowly and looked around, she was in a room she has never been in before, with white walls and curved ceilings, kind of like an old ministry but it looked new,
From her bed, she can see through the open door, a corridor and a courtyard,
She wanted to explore where she was but her body wouldn't move,
Her eyes were her only window,
Nothing in this setting was known to her, only the light felt familiar, but weirdly she felt that she belongs here. She felt that this life is her true life.
She ﬁnally closed her eyes, and when she opened them again she was in her bedroom, she looked around, moved her arms up, and looked out through the window,  she knew that she was in her room, everything was known to her but she felt detached.
Throughout her life she recognised that the sense of not belonging will always be with her.
The ﬁrst thing she can remember is what she thinks was the ﬁrst time she felt fear, back in her family house, the house was in a triangle shape so there wasn’t any place for privacy except at the corner, And on top of those bushes beside hers sat two little children who lived next door. In addition, they had some animals also; 2 dogs walking by their side "What do you think? I don’t believe him", he said angrily as though wanting something from his pets because he didn’t feel safe near these people He thought about how bad things could get if someone got hurt or killed while visiting friends over lunch; It sounds simple enough now until all hope faded away: What did happen? Suddenly one night during breakfast n several other boys grabbed Nana By force then
<br><br>which meant something different from now on as they said "it's going there tomorrow" What does being lost mean for you? What do you want people who don´t know about us or our stories to say? Is love really missing, after all, we just forget ourselves every day
