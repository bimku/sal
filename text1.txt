In the old city, she lived with her friends in a traditional old house, It had two floors and eight rooms on each floor, 5 kitchens in total and 5 bathrooms, It had a garden and a yard in the middle between the rooms and fruit trees and flowers. Her room was in the far inner corner of the garden, and across from it were the clay stairs leading to the basement that no one uses, on the wall stretched between the room on the other inner corner of the garden across the basement stairs and into her room was a vine, then a little round step then the door to her room, it was a long wooden door and above it was a window almost as big as the door, Inside the room had a weird shape, where the walls seemed like they took a little turn to the side and collapsed a bit closer to each other on the top, Each wall had a colour, a purple wall, a yellow wall, a pink wall and one wall was split in half diagonally and was blue on the bottom and green on top. The ceiling tiles are painted red (from their skin) but some tile have silver patches which made them look gold though they could be either by accident or chance due there is usually more paint than you would expect depending on who paints what.. On the ground below this area upstairs at the end of the hallway next me I found another large chamber around its size again not much smaller than my own home's three beds/bathroom space plus extra chairs for myself and those sleeping downstairs beside our bed.   As we waited outside while talking about stuff out loud most people went straight upstairs when things got quiet enough so having an outlet inside wouldn't cause issue
